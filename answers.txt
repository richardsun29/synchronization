1.1:

1. It takes many threads or iterations because there is a race condition
in the add function: before one thread sets the counter variable to a new value,
another thread might read the counter variable and get its old value, modifying
the counter variable using the old value instead of the new one.
So if two different threads both increase the counter at the same time, 
it's possible that the counter variable only actually increments once.
This only happens with two or more threads.

2. The race condition could happen during any iteration,
so with a significantly small number of iterations, there are much fewer
iterations during which this race condition could occur,
so it's more likely that the program will succeed.
